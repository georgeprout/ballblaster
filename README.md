# Fisher-Price Stand-Up Ball Blaster Schematic Diagram

Whilst repairing this toy I found that the wires frequently broke off. So I reverse engineered the PCB to indentify where each wire should go. Here is the schematic / wiring diagram that hopefuly will help you repair yours.

Quality was pretty poor, it needed lots of reflowing of solder joints and replacing wires. But it worked.


To get into the toy, there are 9 screws. 6 are obvious, 1 is under the batteries and the last 2 are ever so slightly inaccessable. Nibbling the blue plastic away slightly let me get a screwdriver bit in there. The plastic is all designed to clip together once and not come apart. The electronics opens easily though once the screws are out.


If you found this helpful, or spotted an error then please let me know. Thanks.
